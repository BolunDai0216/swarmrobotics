# Networked Robotics Systems, Cooperative Control and Swarming (ME-GY 7943 / ECE-GY9273)

This repository provides material used for the class Networked Robotics Systems, Cooperative Control and Swarming (ME-GY 7943 / ECE-GY9273) taught at New York University by Ludovic Righetti. You are free to use and copy this material (at your own risk), please reference the material if you use it.


## Working with python

We work with Python 3.7 - numpy, scipy and matlplotlib are recommended libraries to install (come with Anaconda by default). Most the material is given as Jupyter notebooks.

Anaconda is a straightforward, multi-platform, easy-to-use python distribution. It can be downloaded here https://www.anaconda.com/download/ and extensive documentation is available here https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/

Jupyter (comes with default Anaconda installation) is a great way to create notebooks for python. A simple tutorial can be found here https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Python tutorial (the web is full of great tutorials). Here are links to start: https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/index.html
